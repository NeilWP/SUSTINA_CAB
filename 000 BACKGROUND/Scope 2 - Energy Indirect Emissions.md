## ⚡ Scope 2: Dual Reporting Methods

While Scope 2 only covers one category (**Purchased Energy**), the **GHG Protocol** requires companies to calculate and report emissions using **two distinct methods**. This dual reporting provides a complete picture of a company's environmental impact: the physical reality versus the intentional purchasing decisions.

### 1. 📍 Location-Based Method

This method reflects the emissions generated by the electricity **physically consumed** based on where the company is located.

* **What it Measures:** The **average emissions intensity** of the electricity grid in the specific geographic region (e.g., country, state, or utility area) where the facility operates.
* **Calculation:** Total electricity consumed ($\text{kWh}$) $\times$ **Grid Average Emission Factor** ($\text{kg} \text{CO}_{2}\text{e}/\text{kWh}$).
* **Contractual Instruments:** **Ignored.** This method does *not* take into account a company's purchasing decisions (like buying renewable energy certificates or green tariffs). Everyone on the same grid shares the same average emission factor.
* **Purpose:** To show the **physical reality** of the emissions associated with the actual electricity flowing into the company's premises from the local power system.

### 2. 💰 Market-Based Method

This method reflects the emissions associated with the **commercial and contractual choices** a company makes in purchasing energy.

* **What it Measures:** Emissions from the specific energy sources that the company has legally chosen and contracted for.
* **Calculation:** Total electricity consumed ($\text{kWh}$) $\times$ **Contractual Instrument/Supplier-Specific Factor** ($\text{kg} \text{CO}_{2}\text{e}/\text{kWh}$).
* **Contractual Instruments (EACs):** **Reflected.** The method allows companies to claim a zero or lower emissions factor if they purchase **Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs)**, such as Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs).
* **Residual Mix:** If no specific contractual instrument is in place, the company must use the **Residual Mix Factor** (the average grid factor *after* all claimed renewable energy is removed) or the location-based factor.
* **Purpose:** To reflect the **decarbonization efforts** and strategic purchasing decisions a company has made, which incentivizes investment in renewable energy markets.

### 💡 Why Dual Reporting is Required

The GHG Protocol mandates that companies report **both totals** because they tell two different, complementary stories:

* The **Location-Based** total indicates the company's impact on the local grid's environment.
* The **Market-Based** total indicates the company's contribution to, or demand for, renewable energy development. 

### Reducing Scope 2 Emissions

Because Scope 2 is entirely driven by purchased energy, the reduction strategies are clear and effective:

1.  **Reduce Consumption:** Implement energy efficiency measures (insulation, LED lighting, optimized HVAC) to lower total $\text{kWh}$ use.
2.  **Purchase Renewables:** Enter into Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) or purchase high-quality EACs to drive the market-based emission factor toward zero.
3.  **On-Site Generation:** Install solar panels or other renewable energy on the company's property (this reduces the volume of electricity purchased, lowering *both* location-based and market-based totals).
