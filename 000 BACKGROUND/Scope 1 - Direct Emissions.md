## 🏭 Scope 1: Direct Emissions (4 Categories)

### 1. What does it cover
Scope 1 covers all emissions released directly from sources that your company **owns or controls**. These are typically organised into four main categories:
| Category | Description | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Stationary Combustion** | Burning fuels in fixed equipment at a facility. | Furnaces, boilers, turbines, heaters, flares. |
| **2. Mobile Combustion** | Burning fuels in company-owned transportation. | Emissions from the tailpipes of company-owned/leased cars, trucks, vans, ships, and planes. |
| **3. Fugitive Emissions** | Intentional or unintentional releases of GHGs from equipment leaks. | Leaks from air conditioning or refrigeration units (HFCs), natural gas leaks from pipes, methane from landfills. |
| **4. Process Emissions** | Emissions released during industrial processes, typically through a chemical reaction that is not combustion. | $\text{CO}_2$ released during cement production (calcination) or $\text{CO}_2$ from aluminum smelting. |

### Key Actionable Facts about Scope 1. 
* The **Importance of Control** . The most significant aspect of Scope 1 is that the emissions are directly controlled by the company.  
This means the company has the most direct and immediate ability to reduce them:
 * **Switching Fuels** : Replacing a gas boiler with a heat pump (moving the emission to Scope 2, if electricity is purchased).
 * **Fleet Electrification** : Replacing diesel vans with electric vehicles.

### 2. 🧊 Fugitive Emissions Are Often Forgotten

For many businesses, **Fugitive Emissions** (refrigerant leaks, Category 3) can unexpectedly be a substantial part of their Scope 1 footprint. This is especially true for:

* Large server rooms and data centers.
* Refrigerated warehouses and cold storage.
* Offices with extensive air conditioning systems.

> **Why they matter:** Common refrigerants (Hydrofluorocarbons or **HFCs**) have a **Global Warming Potential (GWP)** that is often thousands of times higher than $\text{CO}_2$, meaning small leaks result in huge $\text{CO}_2$ equivalent emissions.

### 3. ✅ Scope 1 as the Ideal Starting Point for SMEs

For many Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (**SMEs**) that own their own physical assets (workshops, small factories, local delivery fleets), Scope 1 is often the **easiest and best starting point** for carbon accounting.

* **Data is Accessible:** Key data like fuel purchase records and utility bills for on-site combustion are usually readily available within existing finance systems.
* **High Return on Investment (ROI):** Measures that reduce Scope 1 emissions (e.g., improving furnace efficiency, reducing fleet fuel use) directly translate to **lower operational costs**, providing a clear business incentive beyond regulatory reporting.
