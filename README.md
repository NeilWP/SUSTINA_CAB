## What does SUSTINA allow businesses to do?


# 🚀 Carbon Accounting Solution Strategy for SMEs

This document summarizes our planned approach to developing a carbon accounting solution, addressing the key challenges and suggestions raised regarding data, target market, guidance, and competition.

## Strategy Summary Table

| Focus Area | Our Strategic Approach | Key Benefit to SMEs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Conversion Factor Database** | We are building a **proprietary factor library** by **aggregating, curating, and standardizing** data from multiple reputable sources (e.g., UK DESNZ/EPA, IPCC). Our system includes logic to **automatically select** the correct factor based on geography and activity, ensuring proper version control and transparency. | **Auditability & Simplicity:** Ensures factor consistency, proper version control, and eliminates the need for SMEs to be data experts. |
| **2. Target SMEs** | We target two groups of European SMEs: 1. **Supply-Chain Driven B2B** (clients demand Scope 3 data due to **CSRD**) and 2. **ESG-Conscious Growth SMEs** (seeking competitive advantage/investment). | **Commercial Imperative:** Motivation is driven by client demands and market competitiveness, mitigating the risk of relaxed direct EU regulations. |
| **3. Scope/Boundary Guidance & Consultancy** | We use a **guided, automated onboarding flow** based on the **GHG Protocol**. This flow asks simple questions to help SMEs define their initial **Scope 1, 2, and Material Scope 3** boundaries. **Optional advisory services** are available for audit readiness. | **Low Cost & Efficiency:** Most SMEs can self-serve the setup, keeping costs down while providing expert support for validation and high-stakes reporting. |
| **4. Competitor Analysis** | Thorough analysis of leaders like **myclimate** and **Watershed** informed our focus. Our solution prioritizes **simplicity, quick setup, and automated data ingestion** (e.g., accounting system integration). | **Usability & Actionability:** We provide **clear, actionable reduction insights** alongside the footprint calculation, helping SMEs achieve cost savings and efficiency gains. |
| **5. Supplier Impact / Scope 3 Engagement** | We are integrating a unique **Supplier Data Request Portal** directly into the platform. This allows our SME client to send a standardized, minimal data request (e.g., total spend, key material use) to their top suppliers, gradually moving from **Spend-Based Factors** to more accurate **Activity/Supplier-Specific Data**. | **Granularity & Action:** Solves the core Scope 3 data challenge by enabling iterative data improvement without overwhelming the SME or their suppliers, differentiating us from basic spend-based tools. |
| **6. Market Demand Pressure** | The solution is designed to quickly generate the **standardized reports and data formats** required by the SME's key external parties: **Large Customers** (for Scope 3), **Banks/Lenders** (for sustainable financing), and **Investors/Stakeholders**. | **Revenue Protection & Access to Capital:** Helps the SME meet due diligence requirements, secure financing, and retain major contracts by providing verified data on demand. |
## Core Value Proposition

Our core value proposition is transforming complex, expert-driven GHG accounting into a **simple, self-service, and commercially relevant tool** for the average SME.

## Supplier Impact Assessment

SUSTINA provides functionality for businesses to evaluate how their suppliers contribute to, or detract from, their overall ESG performance.  

This feature allows organizations to:

- **Map supplier data** against recognized ESG standards (e.g., NACE Rev. 2 industry codes, emissions categories, social compliance benchmarks).  
- **Quantify supplier impact** by integrating procurement and supply chain information into ESG liability calculations.  
- **Identify high‑risk suppliers** whose practices may negatively affect sustainability KPIs.  
- **Track improvements over time**, enabling businesses to monitor supplier performance and demonstrate progress in ESG reporting.

## Stakeholder Response Capability

SUSTINA equips businesses to respond effectively to ESG-related requests from customers, shareholders, investors, financiers, and insurers.  

Key benefits include:

- **Transparent reporting**  
  Generate clear, standardized ESG disclosures aligned with recognized frameworks (e.g., NACE Rev. 2, ISO standards), ensuring stakeholders receive consistent and credible information.  

- **Evidence-based communication**  
  Use uploaded and mapped data to demonstrate how sustainability KPIs are tracked, calculated, and verified, reducing ambiguity in external reporting.  

- **Risk and liability assessment**  
  Provide quantified insights into ESG liabilities, including supplier impact, enabling financiers and insurers to evaluate exposure with confidence.  

- **Customer and investor assurance**  
  Show proactive management of sustainability performance, strengthening trust and competitive positioning in markets where ESG compliance is a differentiator.  

- **Audit-ready documentation**  
  Maintain a repository of structured, certification-ready records that can be shared with regulators, auditors, or rating agencies on demand.  

By consolidating ESG data into a single platform, SUSTINA helps businesses not only meet stakeholder requests but also **turn compliance into a strategic advantage**.


By incorporating supplier impact into ESG assessments, businesses gain a more complete view of their sustainability footprint and can make informed decisions about procurement, partnerships, and compliance.
