- **Quantify supplier impact** by integrating procurement and supply chain information into ESG liability calculations.

SUSTINA equips businesses to respond effectively to ESG-related requests from customers, shareholders, investors, financiers, and insurers.  

Key benefits include:

- **Transparent reporting**  
  Generate clear, standardized ESG disclosures aligned with recognized frameworks (e.g., NACE Rev. 2, ISO standards), ensuring stakeholders receive consistent and credible information.  

- **Evidence-based communication**  
  Use uploaded and mapped data to demonstrate how sustainability KPIs are tracked, calculated, and verified, reducing ambiguity in external reporting.  

- **Risk and liability assessment**  
  Provide quantified insights into ESG liabilities, including supplier impact, enabling financiers and insurers to evaluate exposure with confidence.  

- **Customer and investor assurance**  
  Show proactive management of sustainability performance, strengthening trust and competitive positioning in markets where ESG compliance is a differentiator.  

- **Audit-ready documentation**  
  Maintain a repository of structured, certification-ready records that can be shared with regulators, auditors, or rating agencies on demand.  

By consolidating ESG data into a single platform, SUSTINA helps businesses not only meet stakeholder requests but also **turn compliance into a strategic advantage**.


By incorporating supplier impact into ESG assessments, businesses gain a more complete view of their sustainability footprint and can make informed decisions about procurement, partnerships, and compliance.
