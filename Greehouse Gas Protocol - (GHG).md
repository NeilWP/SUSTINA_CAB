### 🔑 Key Purpose

The GHG Protocol (Greenhouse Gas Protocol) is the world's most widely used standardized framework for measuring, managing, and reporting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from private and public sector operations, value chains, and mitigation actions.

It was established in a partnership between the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).

The primary goal of the GHG Protocol is to provide a comprehensive, global, and standardized methodology so that businesses and governments can:

1.  **Measure** their emissions accurately and consistently.
2.  **Report** their emissions transparently.
3.  **Manage and Reduce** their emissions over time, helping to meet climate goals (like those outlined in the Paris Agreement).

In 2023, for instance, **97% of the S&P 500 companies** reporting to the CDP used the GHG Protocol, making it the de facto global standard for corporate carbon footprinting.

### The Three Scopes of Emissions

The most famous and widely adopted part of the GHG Protocol is the classification of emissions into three **Scopes**, based on the degree of control and ownership a company has over the source:

| Scope | Definition | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scope 1 (Direct)** | Emissions released directly from sources that the reporting company **owns or controls**. | Emissions from: Company-owned vehicles (fleet), on-site fuel combustion (boilers, furnaces), and industrial processes (e.g., cement making). |
| **Scope 2 (Indirect)** | Emissions from the **generation of purchased energy** consumed by the reporting company. | Emissions from: Purchased electricity, purchased steam, heating, or cooling. |
| **Scope 3 (Other Indirect)** | **All other indirect emissions** that occur in the reporting company's value chain, both **upstream** (suppliers) and **downstream** (customers/use). | Emissions from: Purchased goods & services, business travel, employee commuting, waste disposal, and the use/end-of-life of sold products. |

### Key Standards
The GHG Protocol suite includes several core standards:

* Corporate Standard: The foundational standard for companies and other organizations preparing a corporate-level GHG emissions inventory (covering Scopes 1, 2, and 3).

* Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard: Provides requirements and guidance for companies to assess their entire value chain emissions impact (the hardest but often largest portion of a company's footprint).

* Scope 2 Guidance: Standardizes how companies measure and report emissions from purchased electricity, steam, heat, and cooling.

* Product Standard: Used to understand the full life cycle emissions of a single product.

In short, the GHG Protocol provides the essential rulebook that carbon accounting software and internal sustainability teams use to calculate a company's carbon footprint reliably.
