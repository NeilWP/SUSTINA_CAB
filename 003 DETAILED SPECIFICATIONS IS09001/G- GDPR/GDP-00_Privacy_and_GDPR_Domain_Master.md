## 1. Purpose

This document is the **authoritative master specification** for the Privacy and GDPR (GDP) domain within the SUSTINA platform.

The GDP domain defines **privacy governance, data protection obligations, and regulatory controls** required to ensure lawful, transparent, and accountable processing of personal data.

This domain is **policy-oriented and logical**, and deliberately avoids:
- implementation technologies
- storage engines
- interface protocols
- security mechanisms already governed by the SEC domain
