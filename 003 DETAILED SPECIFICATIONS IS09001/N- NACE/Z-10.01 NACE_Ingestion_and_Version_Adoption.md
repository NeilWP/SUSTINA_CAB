## 1. Purpose

This specification defines **how NACE reference data is ingested, validated, versioned, and made available**
for downstream ESG, Risk, and analytical consumption.

It aligns with:
- ING-00 Sustainability Data Ingestion Framework fileciteturn7file0
- Z-10.00 / Z-10.01 / Z-10.02 / Z-10.03 entity specifications

This document defines **behaviour**, not implementation.

---

## 2. Scope

Covered:
- Adoption of new NACE revisions
- Controlled activation of versions
- Validation and DQ gates
- Backward compatibility

Out of scope:
- Entity industry assignment (Z-01.05)
- ESG factor mapping logic (Z-10.03)

---

## 3. Ingestion Lifecycle

NACE data follows the ING-00 Tier-3 reference ingestion pattern:

```
External Publication
    → RAW_ZONE (immutable)
        → Reference Validation
            → Ref.NACE_* tables
                → Active Version Selection
```

---

## 4. Version Adoption Rules

- Each NACE publication is loaded as a **new version**
- Exactly one version is flagged `Is_Active = 1`
- Deactivation of a version does not delete data
- ESG recalculation against a new version requires explicit governance approval

---

## 5. Validation & Data Quality

Mandatory checks:
- Completeness of activity catalogue
- Hierarchy integrity (Section → Division → Group → Class)
- Orphan detection
- Duplicate code detection
- Version consistency

Failures block activation.

---

## 6. Governance

- Version activation requires Data Steward approval
- All loads are logged and auditable
- RAW_ZONE artefacts are retained indefinitely
