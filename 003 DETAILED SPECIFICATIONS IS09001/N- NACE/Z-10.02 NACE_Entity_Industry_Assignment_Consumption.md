| **Document ID** | **Version** | **Status** | **Owner (Author)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Z-10.F02** | 1.0.0 | **DRAFT** | Business Architect |

---

## 1. Purpose

Defines how **entity-to-industry assignments** (Z-01.05) consume NACE reference data
without violating domain ownership boundaries.

---

## 2. Ownership Boundary

- Z-10 defines **what NACE codes mean**
- Z-01.05 defines **which entities have which codes**
- Z-10 does not create or modify assignments

---

## 3. Consumption Rules

When Z-01.05 assigns a `NACE_Code`:
- Code must exist in Z-10.01 for the active version
- Assignment must reference exactly one version implicitly via activity master
- Invalid or deprecated codes are rejected

---

## 4. Temporal Behaviour

- Historical assignments retain their original meaning
- Reporting resolves NACE meaning via version lineage
- No retroactive mutation of assignments

---

## 5. ESG Context

Entity industry classification is used to:
- Select ESG factors
- Group emissions
- Drive sector-based reporting
