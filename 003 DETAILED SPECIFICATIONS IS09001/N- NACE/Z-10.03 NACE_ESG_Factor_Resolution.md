during curated input assembly and calculation.

- ING-01 Activity Normalisation fileciteturn7file1
- ING-01.01 Activity Categories fileciteturn7file2

## 2. Resolution Flow

```
Normalised_Activity
    → Accounting Entity (Z-09.00)
        → CorporateEntity (Z-01)
            → Entity Industry (Z-01.05)
                → NACE Activity (Z-10)
                    → ESG Factor (Z-10.03)
```

---

## 3. Resolution Rules

- Primary NACE assignment takes precedence
- Fallback to secondary only if explicitly allowed
- Version of NACE is resolved before factor selection

---

## 4. Failure Handling

- Missing industry mapping → flagged, not blocked
- Missing factor → recorded as calculation gap
- All gaps are auditable
